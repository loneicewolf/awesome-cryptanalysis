awesome cryptoanalysis!

1. Take the target file or drive, 
2. Cut it 100mb `tail -...`  and 100mb `head -...` so You have 100MB beginning and 100MB ending of the same file, stored in 2 files.
3. Fire up cryptool
4. feed it into the Workspaces of AES Cryptanalysis (assuming the 100MB_1 and_2, as well as the entire file, is in AES).
5. perform the tests there.
